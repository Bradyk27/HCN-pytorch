**This Week**

1. Converted LIDAR MOCAP data to readable .skeleton format, including being padded w/ appropriate number of joints, with help from Alex & Joe.
2. Received Wahab access, set up testing environment & accompanying Slurm scripts to run with help from Meghan.
3. Adapted existing code to work with updated version of Numpy & PyTorch. Created pull request on original Github repo.
4. Successfully trained and tested HCN-PyTorch model on NTURGBD data, received ~94% accuracy on testing and evaluation data.
5. Attended DeapSECURE deep-learning seminar for 3 days. Gained more experience with Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, and working remotely on Wahab.
6. Presented bi-weekly progress for Dr. Xin, who seemed very please.
7. Friday, Saturday, Sunday will be devoted to running the now-working HCN-PyTorch model on our converted LIDAR MOCAP data. 

**Next Week**

1. Finish running HCN-PyTorch model on our data
2. Begin learning GAN to create noisy, more difficult data.

**Future**
1. Continue meeting with Dr. Khan, Alex, Joe, Meghan to help decide further progress for the project.
