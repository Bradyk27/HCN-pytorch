**This Week**

1. Calibrated and performed a test run of the HCN-PyTorch implementation.
2. Kept a running list of necessary steps, libraries, data, etc. to do so, so it can be easily recreated.
3. Received LIDAR MOCAP data, ran sample code for visualization.
4. Read & understand current data labeling for the HCN-PyTorch implementation.
5. Started work on Python converter for LIDAR MOCAP data to be turned into .skeleton format. Found sample Matlab code to begin with.

**Next Week**

1. Successfully convert LIDAR MOCAP data to readable .skeleton format.
2. Relabel data for person identification over action recognition.
3. Run sample train / test on the HCN-PyTorch model.
4. Note where code may need to be edited.

**Future**

1. Create fully working model for person identification.
2. Learn GAN w/ help from Meghan.
