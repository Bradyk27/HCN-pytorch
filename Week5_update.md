**This Week**

1. Continued running parameter tests to fine tune the model--ran ~40 different combinations of patience, # epochs, and learning rate to slightly disappointing results
2. Successfully downloaded and ran the ACGAN code
3. Attended graduate school workshop and found it very informative and well put together.

**Next Week**

1. A few more attempts at stretching our data.
2. Should #1 fail, relabeling and repurposing the NTURGBD dataset by freezing & loading the model.

**Future**
1. Continue meeting with Dr. Khan, Alex, Joe, Meghan to help decide further progress for the project.
