0. Just train & test the HCN01 & HCN02 model again, with new data. (local machine)
1. Set train_eval to 10
2. Try frames of 5 (wahab) & 3 
3. Try leave one out cross validation. Would most certainly need to shell script this which would be a huge bitch.
4. Freeze & Train with relabeled NTURGBD dataset
